# Template for quick prototyping using Rust 

This is repo with code accompanying (not yet published) post: "how to prototype services

I wanted to collect all advices from noticable Rust developers, applicable heuristics and general "quality of life" tips & tricks in one place so to help people coming from other languages start something with "good enough" defaults already configured.
